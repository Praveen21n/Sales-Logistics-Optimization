## Data Processing
### Understanding the Data

### Cleaning the Data

2. **Handling Missing Values** - Addressed missing or incomplete data by filling gaps or removing irrelevant rows.
3. **Ensuring Consistency in Formatting** - Standardized formats for dates, numerical values, and text.

### Adding Calculations and Columns
New columns were created for enhanced analysis:
